Version 1.2

This font is FREE. Freeware. No quarter asked, no quarter given.
Please do not redistribute without expressly written consent of the creator (Down10 aka Jesse Burgheimer).

Changes in 1.2:
- Adjusted line height.

Changes in 1.1:
- Added the Question Mark, by demand. But for what purpose???


Rationale: 
This is a font based entirely on the McDonald's "Golden arches." You know, the "M." I just took the original logo and sliced it up and pasted it together into an entire alphabet. It includes A-Z, 0-9, and all general punctuation, and keyboard characters.

The reason this font is called McLawsuit is that Micky-D's is valiant in protecting the intellectual property of their products, and it mostly comes across as pure dominance. But maybe they'll dig this font instead of wanting to slap me with some Cease and Desist order. Have you had your break today?
